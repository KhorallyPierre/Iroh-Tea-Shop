How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB


Lessons Learned:
I learned how to use MongoDB's ID to target different orders so that individual orders can be deleted. I also learned how to move orders from one list to another (from active orders to completed orders). I also included the cross-out function for orders that are completed. I hope you enjoy my cartoon theme! When I was learning English Avatar The Last AirBender really motivated me to learn new words.

Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
